                    I grew up looking at life as a story book. I enjoyed looking at the world through different eyes from others. I found myself finding the beauty in things that others would find no just be ordinary. As I grew up, I found myself attracted to art. I tried all I could and develop my eye even further allowing me to see the world in so many different manners. I loved seen what others couldn't. I enjoy been playful and having fun when I can. I believe that one should try to enjoy the moments of life as best as they can. I try to do just that in everything I do. Bring a fun creative world I know to life.

                    I had interest for photography at a very early age, but did not explore my curiosity for it till later in life. As I had developed my way of looking at the world because of my artistic tendencies I found it to be a great strength in my development in photography.  It made photography that much more fun. It made photography an art a way for me to tell of places I have been, of things I had done, of people I have met. Photography became my way of keeping my memories alive for me to continually remember through my life.
