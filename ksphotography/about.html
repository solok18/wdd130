                    My name is Kevin, I am someone who enjoys to have a good time and look at the world through the eyes of and artist. I believe that everything had a unique beauty and I Love to capture that beauty in a photo to remember it through out my life. I have a passion for learning new things be people, places, or things. It brings me joy to see others smile and have a good time specially if I have a small part to play in that. I am an artist at heart and believe photography is an art that can show what you see in a different way than other art mediums.

                    I began to have an interest in photography as a kid when I saw my family work in their studio. As I grew I saw other styles of photography and stared to see the world in a different way. As a kid I developed my artistic skills giving me a unique eye to see through. As I became an adult, I was able to get my fist camera and start to play with what I could do with it. I enjoyed taking photos of the outdoors and then of people and developed a love to capture moments that were special.
