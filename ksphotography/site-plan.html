        Welcome to your life's story. My approach to photography is one of a story. We all go through a journey in life, meeting new people, making lasting relationships and discovering new places. We make memories that are irreplaceable, memories we want to last forever. I want to help in making those memories last by capturing specially moments in your life that you can look back at and remember with fondness. Memories that will not only last one life time but many more. I want to help you tell your life's story through photography. 
        Photography is not just about pressing buttons and taking photos. Photography is about capturing a chapter in your life's story. It is about keeping a record of a time in your life that you will want to last forever. It is about freezing time in a physical object you can hold over and over again through life remembering the moment for generation to come.
        "If you can see it, you can shoot it."- Ted Grant

        What do I capture for you? Well, that can depend of you personally. A special moment, place, or someone can differ by person. I believe that as each individual is different from another so is what is special to them. I want to show how there is not a limit to what can or cannot be special. The Photos you will see will represent those special moment, someone, and/or things from different individuals in life. I want to show the special things that others hold value to and will want to pass on to others through time

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I grew up looking at life as a story book. I enjoyed looking at the world through different eyes from others. I found myself finding the beauty in things that others would find no just be ordinary. As I grew up, I found myself attracted to art. I tried all I could and develop my eye even further allowing me to see the world in so many different manners. I loved seen what others couldn't. I enjoy been playful and having fun when I can. I believe that one should try to enjoy the moments of life as best as they can. I try to do just that in everything I do. Bring a fun creative world I know to life. 
	      I had interest for photography at a very early age, but did not explore my curiosity for it till later in life. As I had developed my way of looking at the world because of my artistic tendencies I found it to be a great strength in my development in photography.  It made photography that much more fun. It made photography an art a way for me to tell of places I have been, of things I had done, of people I have met. Photography became my way of keeping my memories alive for me to continually remember through my life.
