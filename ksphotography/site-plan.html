      <p>
        Welcome to my world. This is a place where I show you the moments, times and places you can keep for generations to come. We all are fond of wanting to have lasting moments with no end in sight. But our brain sometimes does not keep those moment alive forever. In this place we can keep that moment alive by freezing it in a photo. So that when you start to forget it you can spark your memory to remember that special someone, moment or place by just looking at a photo. A photo is not just a piece of paper but a slide of your life and what you got to live so that you can share it with friend or loves ones. Or to just keep to never forget the good times. It is a way for us to live forever in the memories of everyone we loved and those to come and not be forgotten by time.
	      What do you need? Well, there is no limit to this. It just has to be something special. It can be as big as a scenery in your back yard or as small as a button. The important thing is it special to you and do you want to keep it forever.
        What can a photo do for me? Well, Time can take things from us. For Example, a beautiful scenery can change in a blink of an eye and no longer be there to admire. But a photo is a reminder of that which existed and now is gone. The photo will not let you forget what you saw and can be enough to even help you remember how feelings you felt when from what is in the photo.

        What do I capture for you? Well, that can depend of you personally. A special moment, place, or someone can differ by person. I believe that as each individual is different from another so is what is special to them. I want to show how there is not a limit to what can or cannot be special. The Photos you will see will represent those special moment, someone, and/or things from different individuals in life. I want to show the special things that others hold value to and will want to pass on to others through time

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Kevin, I am someone who enjoys to have a good time and look at the world through the eyes of and artist. I believe that everything had a unique beauty and I Love to capture that beauty in a photo to remember it through out my life. I have a passion for learning new things be people, places, or things. It brings me joy to see others smile and have a good time specially if I have a small part to play in that. I am an artist at heart and believe photography is an art that can show what you see in a different way than other art mediums. 
	      I began to have an interest in photography as a kid when I saw my family work in their studio. As I grew I saw other styles of photography and stared to see the world in a different way. As a kid I developed my artistic skills giving me a unique eye to see through. As I became an adult, I was able to get my fist camera and start to play with what I could do with it. I enjoyed taking photos of the outdoors and then of people and developed a love to capture moments that were special. Now I just look at the
