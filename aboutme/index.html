    <p>Hi everyone. Let me tell you a little about myself. I live in California. Been living here for the past 23 years. I was born in Guatemala and moved to the US when I was 10. I love to Draw and would say pencil drawings are my strongest medium. I also love to do photography. I recently picked up reading books more than I used to I like it since it keep me busy when I normally would had been on social media.
     </p>
        
    <p>I been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints my entire life. I grew up with the teaching of the gospel since i could learn. A favorite scripture of mine is D&C 58:26-28 <em>"For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things;... Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will... And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward."</em></p>

    <p>I am pursuing a bachelor's in web and computer programing. I still do not have a focus on something specific I would like to do but I'm looking forward to figuring it out as i keep progressing in coding. So far I have enjoyed coding more than I though I would and even when at time it can be challenging I still have fun doing it.</p>

    <p>I am looking forward to working with everyone and seen what kind of ideas we all can come up with.</p>
